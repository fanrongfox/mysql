## 操作步骤
- 查找表内goods_name重复的数据
```
SELECT 
    tg.goods_name
FROM
    tdb_goods tg
GROUP BY tg.goods_name
HAVING COUNT(tg.goods_name) >= 2
```
- 选出重复goods_named对应的最小goods_id或者最大的goods_id
```
SELECT 
    MIN(goods_id) AS goods_id
FROM
    tdb_goods
WHERE
    goods_name IN (SELECT 
            tg.goods_name
        FROM
            tdb_goods tg
        GROUP BY tg.goods_name
        HAVING COUNT(tg.goods_name) >= 2)
```
- 删除goods_name重复，除最大goods_id或者最小goods_id的内容
```
DELETE FROM tdb_goods 
WHERE
    goods_name IN (SELECT 
        *
    FROM
        (SELECT 
            tg.goods_name
        FROM
            tdb_goods tg
        GROUP BY tg.goods_name
        HAVING COUNT(tg.goods_name) >= 2) a)
    AND goods_id NOT IN (SELECT 
        *
    FROM
        (SELECT 
            MIN(goods_id) AS goods_id
        FROM
            tdb_goods
        
        WHERE
            goods_name IN (SELECT 
                *
            FROM
                (SELECT 
                tg.goods_name
            FROM
                tdb_goods tg
            GROUP BY tg.goods_name
            HAVING COUNT(tg.goods_name) >= 2) b)
        GROUP BY goods_name) c)
```
